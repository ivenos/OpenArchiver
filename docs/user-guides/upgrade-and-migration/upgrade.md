# Upgrading Your Instance

This guide provides instructions for upgrading your Open Archiver instance to the latest version.

## Checking for New Versions

Open Archiver automatically checks for new versions and will display a notification in the footer of the web interface when an update is available. You can find a list of all releases and their release notes on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LogicLabs-OU/OpenArchiver/releases) page.

## Upgrading Your Instance

To upgrade your Open Archiver instance, run the following commands from your deployment directory:

1.  **Pull the latest Docker images**:

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```

2.  **Restart the services with the new images**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

This will restart your Open Archiver instance with the latest version of the application.

If a release announces changes to `compose.yaml` itself (for example a new service or a renamed volume), re-download it before restarting:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LogicLabs-OU/OpenArchiver/main/compose.yaml
```

The release notes will call this out explicitly when it is needed.

## Migrating Data

When you upgrade to a new version, database migrations are applied automatically when the application starts up. This ensures that your database schema is always up-to-date with the latest version of the application.

No manual intervention is required for database migrations.

There is one exception, and it applies only when upgrading from v0.5.1. If the application fails to start with `index row requires N bytes, maximum size is 8191` in the migration output, see [Long Message-ID Headers](../troubleshooting/long-message-id.md).

## The `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` variables are no longer used

Very early versions of Open Archiver configured the administrator account through the `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables. A compatibility shim kept honouring them and created the account automatically on first start. That shim has been removed.

The first administrator is now created only on the `/setup` page, which appears automatically the first time you open an instance that has no accounts yet. If your `.env` still defines `ADMIN_EMAIL` or `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, they are ignored and can be deleted.

Instances that already completed the upgrade are unaffected, because the administrator account is stored in the database. Only an instance that has never had a user created — for example a reinstall against an empty database — will show the setup page again.

## Duplicate emails and stalled sources in v0.5.4

Before v0.5.4, two sync cycles could run over the same mailbox at the same time. Both checked for an existing copy of a message, both found none, and both archived it. Ingestion sources covering the same mailbox therefore ended up reporting different email counts while every one of them reported a successful sync.

v0.5.4 stops the cycles from overlapping, so no new duplicates are created. **Copies already in your archive are left exactly as they are.** The upgrade does not delete any email, and no migration touches your data.

If you want to find the copies already in your archive, an email archived twice carries the same `Message-ID` and the same content as its copy, and the two were archived within a second of each other. Removing them is not offered in this version.

The same release also frees ingestion sources that had silently stopped syncing. A source interrupted mid-cycle could be left showing a status of `syncing` that never finished, and because only `active` and `error` sources are scheduled, it was never picked up again — it simply stopped archiving new mail while continuing to look busy. Such a source is now detected and rescheduled automatically within one sync cycle after the upgrade, and archives whatever it missed in the meantime. Mail deleted from the mail server while a source was stalled cannot be recovered.

## Upgrading Meilisearch

When an Open Archiver update includes a major version change for Meilisearch, you will need to manually migrate your search data. This process is not covered by the standard upgrade commands.

For detailed instructions, please see the [Meilisearch Upgrade Guide](./meilisearch-upgrade.md).
