# Upgrading Meilisearch

Meilisearch, the search engine used by Open Archiver, requires a manual data migration process when upgrading to a new version. This is because Meilisearch databases are only compatible with the specific version that created them.

If an Open Archiver upgrade includes a major Meilisearch version change, you will need to migrate your search index by following the process below.

## Experimental: Dumpless Upgrade

> **Warning:** This feature is currently **experimental**. We do not recommend using it for production environments until it is marked as stable. Please use the [standard migration process](#standard-migration-process-recommended) instead. Proceed with caution.

Meilisearch recently introduced an experimental "dumpless" upgrade method. This allows you to migrate the database to a new Meilisearch version without manually creating and importing a dump. However, please note that **dumpless upgrades are not currently atomic**. If the process fails, your database may become corrupted, resulting in data loss.

**Prerequisite: Create a Snapshot**

Before attempting a dumpless upgrade, you **must** take a snapshot of your instance. This ensures you have a recovery point if the upgrade fails. Learn how to create snapshots in the [official Meilisearch documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/data_backup/snapshots).

### How to Enable

To perform a dumpless upgrade, you need to configure your Meilisearch instance with the experimental flag. You can do this in one of two ways:

**Option 1: Using an Environment Variable**

Add the `MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_DUMPLESS_UPGRADE` environment variable to your `compose.yaml` file for the Meilisearch service.

```yaml
services:
    meilisearch:
        image: getmeili/meilisearch:v1.x # The new version you want to upgrade to
        environment:
            - MEILI_MASTER_KEY=${MEILI_MASTER_KEY}
            - MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_DUMPLESS_UPGRADE=true
```

**Option 2: Using a CLI Option**

Alternatively, you can pass the `--experimental-dumpless-upgrade` flag in the command section of your `compose.yaml`.

```yaml
services:
    meilisearch:
        image: getmeili/meilisearch:v1.x # The new version you want to upgrade to
        command: meilisearch --experimental-dumpless-upgrade
```

After updating your configuration, restart your container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Meilisearch will attempt to migrate your database to the new version automatically.

## Standard Migration Process (Recommended)

For self-hosted instances using Docker Compose, the recommended migration process involves creating a data dump from your current Meilisearch instance, upgrading the Docker image, and then importing that dump into the new version.

### Step 1: Create a Dump

Before upgrading, you must create a dump of your existing Meilisearch data. You can do this by sending a POST request to the `/dumps` endpoint of the Meilisearch API.

1.  **Find your Meilisearch container name**:

    ```bash
    docker compose ps
    ```

    Look for the service name that corresponds to Meilisearch, usually `meilisearch`. If it differs, replace it in the exec commands below.

2.  **Execute the dump command**:
    You will need your Meilisearch Admin API key, which can be found in your `.env` file as `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`.

    ```bash
    docker compose exec meilisearch curl -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/dumps' \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MEILI_MASTER_KEY"
    ```

    This will start the dump creation process. The dump file will be created inside the `meili_data` volume used by the Meilisearch container.

3.  **Monitor the dump status**:
    The dump creation request returns a `taskUid`. You can use this to check the status of the dump:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec meilisearch curl 'http://localhost:7700/tasks/YOUR_TASK_UID' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MEILI_MASTER_KEY"     
    ```

    Once the task `status` field reads `succeeded`, you can continue with the next steps.

4.  **Get the Dump file name**:
    To import the dump, you will need the filename:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec meilisearch ls /meili_data/dumps

    ```

    If there are multiple files returned, the filenames will be a datestamps, so the most recent one will be the correct one to use.

    For more details on dump and import, see the [official Meilisearch documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/update_and_migration/updating).
    
### Step 2: Upgrade Your Open Archiver Instance

Once the dump is successfully created, you can proceed with the standard Open Archiver upgrade process.

1.  **Pull the latest changes and Docker images**:

    ```bash
    git pull
    docker compose pull
    ```

2.  **Stop the running services**:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

### Step 3: Import the Dump

Now, you need to restart the services while telling Meilisearch to import from your dump file.

1.  **Modify `compose.yaml`**:
    You need to temporarily add the `--import-dump` flag to the Meilisearch service command. Find the `meilisearch` service in your `compose.yaml` and add a `command` section:

    ```yaml
    services:
        meilisearch:
            # ... other service config
            command:
                [
                    '/bin/meilisearch',
                    '--master-key=${MEILI_MASTER_KEY}',
                    '--env=production',
                    '--import-dump=/meili_data/dumps/YOUR_DUMP_FILE.dump',
                ]
    ```
2.  **Remove the old DB**
    Meilisearch will not import a dump while the existing DB is in place, so it must be removed before starting the container. You can remove it from the host system now while the container is not running. Find where the meilisearch volume is mounted on the host:

    ```bash
    docker volume inspect openarchiver_meilidata
    ```

    In the output for this will be a field labeled `"Mountpoint"`. Navigate to that folder, and delete or rename the `data.ms` folder from within it.
    
3.  **Restart the services**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    Meilisearch will now start and import the data from the dump file. This may take some time depending on the size of your index.

### Step 4: Clean Up

Once the import is complete and you have verified that your search is working correctly, you should remove the `--import-dump` flag from your `compose.yaml` to prevent it from running on every startup.

1.  **Restore the docker compose file**: Remove the  `command` section of the `meilisearch` service in `compose.yaml`.
2.  **Restart the services one last time**:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Delete the dump**:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec meilisearch rm /meili_data/dumps/YOUR_DUMP_FILE.dump
    ```

Your Meilisearch instance is now upgraded and running with your migrated data.
